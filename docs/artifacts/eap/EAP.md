## A8: Vertical prototype

This artifact contains the implementation of most of the high priority user stories of our web application and all mandatory features for its vertical prototype (features marked with an * in the common and theme requirements documents).
Our implementation is based on the LBAW Framework and includes work both on the client and server side of the application, focusing both on user interface and server data access. By implementing all the features described in this section, our protoype has a functional implementation of all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

### 2. Prototype

The prototype Docker image is available at GitLab's Registry Container and can be run with:

```bash
docker run -d --name lbaw2435 -p 8001:80 gitlab.up.pt:5050/lbaw/lbaw2425/lbaw2435
```

For **ARM** users (e.g., Apple Silicon Macs), Docker Desktop supports architecture emulation using `qemu`. You can run the image with:
```bash
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -d --name lbaw2435 -p 8001:80 gitlab.up.pt:5050/lbaw/lbaw2425/lbaw2435
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8001`

Credentials:
- admin user: admin@example.com
- buyer user: buyer@example.com
- seller user: seller@example.com
- password (for all of them): `1234`
