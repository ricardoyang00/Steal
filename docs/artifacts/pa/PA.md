> **"SO AFFORDABLE IT'S LIKE STEALING!"** 

## A9: Product

We developed **STEAL!**, an innovative online platform designed to revolutionize the purchase of game CDKs (Content Distribution Keys). Our goal was to create an affordable, user-friendly marketplace that competes with industry giants like Steam, Uplay, and Origin.

### Key Features:
1. **Game Recommendations:** The system suggests games basesd on user’s past orders, and also the top-seller games, enhancing discovery based on interests.
    
2. **Filters and Search:** Users can easily find games with advanced filtering by category, platform, language, player modes and price, alongside a robust full-text search feature.

3. **Wishlist and Notifications:** Users are notified in real time when their wishlisted items go on sale or are restocked.

4. **Personalized Profiles:** Customizable user profiles allow users to tailor their experience, complete with profile pictures and purchase histories.

5. **Reward System:** Buyers earn S coins as cashback from purchases, which can be used for discounts on future purchases.

6. **Checkout Options:** Buyers can purchase a single game or an entire shopping cart, supporting multiple payment methods.

7. **Account Management:** Administrators can manage user activity by blocking/unblocking or deleting accounts for security and compliance. They also oversee games, categories, and other metadata to ensure accurate listings and a high-quality user experience.

### 1. Installation

To start the Docker image available at the group's GitLab Container Registry using the production database, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name lbaw2435 -p 8001:80 gitlab.up.pt:5050/lbaw/lbaw2425/lbaw2435
```
For ARM users (e.g., Apple Silicon Macs) you can run the image with:

```bash
docker run --platform linux/arm64 -d --name lbaw2435 -p 8001:80 gitlab.up.pt:5050/lbaw/lbaw2425/lbaw2435
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8001`

### 2. Usage

#### 2.1. Administration Credentials

> Administration URL: http://localhost:8001/profile

| Username | Email | Password |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| admin    | admin@example.com | 1234

#### 2.2. User Credentials

| Type | Username | Email | Password |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | -------- |
| Buyer Account | buyer1 | buyer1@example.com | 1234 |

### 3. Application Help

> We primarily provide assistance through error messages when users encounter issues, but we have also implemented some static pages to help users in some specific problems, like FAQs or about our feature S-Coins.

![FAQs](../assets/images/faq.jpeg)
![SCoins_Help](../assets/images/scoins.jpeg)

> We also have info icons to help users know what needs to be done in specific sections. Users can check by hovering the cursor over the icons

![Seller_Help](../assets/images/seller.jpeg)

### 4. Input Validation

> We ensure robust data validation by implementing both client-side and server-side validation techniques. Additionally, we use JavaScript to restrict input in specific cases.

#### Validate S-Coins input before shopping cart checkout

![Scoins_Input_JS](../assets/images/scoins_js.png)

#### Validate attributes before updating profile

![Update_Profile](../assets/images/update_profile.png)


**Note:** For profile pictures or game media, we ensure proper image substitution by deleting the old image when updating with a new one. Additionally, if an image is deleted directly from the database (in this project's case,  from the file system), our system checks if the file exists. If the file is missing, it will automatically use the path of the default image for display.

### 5. Check Accessibility and Usability

> Accessibility: 16/18 ([view accessibility test](../assets/pdf/Accessibility.pdf))

We didn't specifically use &lt;fieldset&gt; nor &lt;legend&gt; but we think we have organized the forms in a easy-to-understand manner.

Some forms errors are not displayed near the inputs/labels to maintain a minimalist and clean appearance.

> Usability: 23/28 ([view usability test](../assets/pdf/Usability.pdf))

We had to define some fixed height and width for images to ensure consistent layout and presentation across different sections of the application.

We also didn't try to optimize the contents for mobile, as our project focused mainly in web part.

### 6. HTML & CSS Validation

> HTML: [Game Details Page Report](../assets/pdf/game-details-html.pdf) ([view file here](../../resources/views/pages/game-details.blade.php))

> CSS: [Game Details Page CSS Report](../assets/pdf/game-details-css.pdf) ([view file here](../../public/css/game_details.css))

### 7. Revisions to the Project

> We made some changes to the database and relationships to improve functionality and performance. However, overall, the project followed our initial specifications and objectives closely, ensuring that the core features and design principles were maintained.
